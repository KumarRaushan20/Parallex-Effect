            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders. A paraglider is an airplane in your backpack. No seriously! It is an aircraft which is powered by the wind and when not flying, fits in a backpack easy enough to be carried around. Paragliding is the closest a human being can get to the feeling of flying. A paraglider is a simple aircraft with no machines and no fuel, just the wind and pilot’s flying skills.
                <br> <br>
                Paragliding equipment comprises a wing or canopy called a ‘paraglider’ made up of two layers of fabric made of high-performance non-porous materials such as rip-stop polyester or nylon. The wing is connected to a harness with a network of suspended lines made of an immensely strong material like Kevlar. The pilot straps on this harness and after a foot launch into the wind is able to sit comfortably in the harness and control the flight. Paragliders have just two controls – on the left and right of the pilot which are used for turning and as brakes.

                The SURFRIDER FOUNDATION is a non-profit organization that works to protect and preserve the world’s oceans, waves, and beaches. The site shows their dedication to bringing awareness to the problems our oceans are facing, cleaning up and taking care of the beaches that are both closed, and open throughout the world. Nationwide, in just about every state, some portion of the beach is public land, which means that all members of the public have the right to use that portion of the beach. Surfrider recognizes that access to public beaches is the public’s right of access to waterways. The foundation also realizes the safety hazards of having a polluted ocean. Polluted oceans can mean dangers for swimmers and for other sea creatures that are important to us and our well-being. This beach friendly foundation is working very hard to preserve and protect our oceans, waves, and beaches and is making progress in doing so.
